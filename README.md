# Dummy-Launcher
A Java-Based Application Launcher for Windows
# How To Compile
just import the files into your eclipse workspace and that is it!

Zip : so for example, i have my workspace at C:\Users|UltraTechX\Desktop\Garrett A
I would extract the folder inside the zip file to my workspace location. Done!

Cloning : After it finishes cloning it right click it in the github desktop application and click "Show in explorer".
Then, go back on directory when it opens and in the file area you should see Dummy-Launcher-master, copy that into your workspace. Done!
#Installers
Nope! All of the files are inside the compiled project! And the files that can be loaded faster if extracted can be found at C:\Program Data\Dummy Launcher
#Windows Only?
Currently, yes.  But I hope to have it more universal sometime later. Its just that I have never worked with macs, so I haven't been able to see its file system architecture, and the same goes with linux.  But I will get to working with that soon enough!
#I don't like the current startup picture
Don't worry, that's just a placeholder for now, I just didn't have the time to make a professional one.
