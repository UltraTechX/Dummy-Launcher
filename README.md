# Dummy-Launcher
A Java-Based Application Launcher for Windows
# How To Compile
just import the files into your eclipse workspace and that is it!
so for example, i have my workspace at C:\Users|UltraTechX\Desktop\Garrett A
so i would either download the zip of this, then extract the folder inside to your workspace.
#Installers
Nope! All of the files are inside the compiled project! And the files that can be loaded faster if extracted can be found at C:\Program Data\Dummy Launcher
#Windows Only?
Currently, yes.  But I hope to have it more universal sometime later. Its just that I have never worked with macs, so I haven't been able to see its file system architecture, and the same goes with linux.  But I will get to working with that soon enough!
